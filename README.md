## EDUCATION

APPLIED MATHEMATICS B.S.
STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COLLEGE AT BUFFALO

President of both the Physics Club and Math League, I had the opportunity to participate in a paid fellowship research program sponsored by the NSF called Urge to Compute. In the fellowship I was on a team of students guided by a faculty member from the University at Buffalo which built a computer modeling communications transfer through fiber optic networks, and studied the degradation of signals over great distances to predict outages and fault tolerances of current hardware. The model was run in UB's Center for Computational Research to realize it’s full potential. Our findings were presented at an undergraduate research conference at Penn State, and at the JMM conference in San Francisco.
 Collaborated with other engineers, business analysts and project managers to plan, design,
develop, test, and maintain web-based enterprise level applications.
